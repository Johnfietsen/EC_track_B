# Evolutionary Computing Research Track - Direct encoding with learning

In this project, evolution of robots is researched under different environmental conditions, as part of the Evolutionary Computing Research Track 2018-2019 at the VU University, Amsterdam. The project makes use of the revolve framework for robot evolution and is focussed on direct encoding of the robots with learning incorporated.
